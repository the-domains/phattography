On a 10 mile stretch of road between Weed, California, and the last public rest stop on the California side of Hwy 97 is quite possibly my favorite view of the western United States. I have driven through here several times on my way to visit dear friends who live in Bend, Oregon, and I always look forward to reaching this point of the trip. The views in this area are spectacular, weather permitting of course. Today, was no exception.

While there was a great deal of cloud cover, the fog remained on the Mount Shasta side of the road which left clear views of the mountains you see below.

This was a six shot panoramic merge that I barely managed to get processed before Lightroom CC crashed and would no longer work. I quickly opened the resulting merged file in Photoshop to clean up the cropped edges and play around with the colors a bit. I'm not quite happy with the colors but the clarity of the mountains is exactly what I wanted. Hopefully I can fix whatever broke Lightroom so I can keep tweaking this little gem. :)
